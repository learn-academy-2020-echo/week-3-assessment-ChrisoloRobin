7. What are props in React?

  Your answer: A one way path to share information within react. Can be used to send information back "up stream"

  Researched answer: We can pass information to another component as props. Props are great, but they are limited in their functionality. Props can only be passed in one direction. React has a one way flow of information through the component call.

  Data and behavior can be passed using props from a parent component to a child component. The variable name is created to contain information from the state object. It is passed to the GreetPerson component inside of the component call. Then in the GreetPerson component the information is available by referencing the variable as props.
